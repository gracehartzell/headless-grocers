# Proposal

## Intro

Let’s face it: ordering groceries could be a lot simpler than manually ordering
items online. So how do we fix it? That’s where this hero comes in. This product
will take your recipe bank (unfortunately, you’ll need to input recipes for
now...so inconvenient, we know) and will populate an online grocery cart to take
the pain of your search and select out of your life!

## Problem Statement

Ordering groceries takes up a large amount of time over the years so why not
make it simpler? The problem is simple: ordering groceries online is not
automated enough. Solution: have the computer take over the bulk of the legwork
for you! All the user will need to do is upload their recipes and set the
schedule for ordering.

## Goals

My solution is to use the MERN stack for the core of this project and will (most
likely) use Puppeteer and Chrome Headless for scraping.

## MVP Tickets

- Have a database that stores the recipes for future use
- Have a user input for which recipes they’d like and when they’d like to set
  their pickup time
- Scrape the website to populate a shopping cart
- Prompt the user to review and finalize the shopping cart
- Stretch: be able to scrape a recipe so that the user doesn’t even have to
  enter the ingredients and quantities.
- I’d love toy. be able to have the app choose what your meals for the week will
  be; however, that is going to be a stretch goal for now since it’s not
  immediately necessary
